1. Timely delivery is crucial in software project management because 
a. It heps ensure that project milestones nd deadlines are met
b. It leads to optimal resource utilizationa and optimization and prevents bottlenecks, while helping teams work cohesively towards project goals.
c. It allows for identification and mitigation of potential risks that may delay the project.

Project Managers can ensure deadlines are met by identifying critical tasks and their potential impacts on project duration, this can help them allocate buffer time and resources effectively. 


2 a. Effective Cost control contributes to the success of a software project by:
i. Managing Budgets
ii. Preventing cost overruns

b. Strategies used to prevent budget overruns include
i. Thorough Project Planning.
ii. Know your vendors
iii. Keep to planned scope
iv. Keep stakeholders updated as proper communication may prevent delay
v. Monitor progress
vi. Reassign resources

3. AGILE VS. WATERFALL METHODLOGIES
a. Agile uses iterative and incremental approach while Waterfall uses a linear and sequential approach
b. Agile emphasizes flexibility, collaboration and customer feedback while in Waterfall, each phases must be completed before the next begins.

Advantages of Agile
i. Quick response to changes
ii. Regular customer feedback
iii. improved collaboration

Disadvantages of Agile
i. Less predictability
ii. Requires significant customer participation

Advantages of Waterfall
i. Clear structure/documentation
ii. Easy to manage due to its rigidity

Disadvantages of WAterfall
i. Difficult to accommodate changes
ii. Testing occurs late in the process.

4. Agile is better suited for projects 
- where stakeholders are closely involved every step of the way. 
- Require flexibility and adaptability
- Have uncertain and changing requirements
- Need rapid prototyping and testing
- Involve high levels of complexity and uncertainty

Examples:
- Research and development projects
- Software Developments
- Product Developments

Waterfall is more suited for projects that
- Have a defined end goal
- Have well-defined requirements
- Need strict regulatory compliance
- Involve linear, phase-by-phase execution

Examples:
- contruction projects (buildings, bridges)
- Government projects with strict regulations
- Manufacturing production lines

5a. METHODS OF ENSURING QUALITY ASSURANCE
i. Proper/Strategic Planning
ii. Tool selection
iii. Execution
iv. Monitoring Progress
v. Continuous Improvement
vi. Software Test Automation

Maintining high standards is important because it:
i. Ensures reliable and stable software
ii. Reduces bugs and errors
iii. Enhances credibility
iv. Improves user experience/satisfaction
v. Encourages team collaboration

6.a.Project scope in software development 
- Ensures a smooth workflow 
- Gives better control over the project. 
- Gives the project manager and the client a better understanding of the deadlines and deliverables
- Makes it easy to evaluate every step, and to see if it meets stakeholders' expectations.


b. A work breakdown structure (WBS) is a project management system that breaks projects into smaller, more manageable components or tasks. It is a visual tool that breaks down the entire project to make it easier to plan, organize, and track progress. It is useful because it
- Enhances team understanding and communication
- Facilitates task assignment and tracking
- Visualizes the project's scope and activities
- Helps estimate time, costs and resources.

7a. Benefits of a detailed Project Schedule:
- Project Schedule allows work to be prioritized.
- Allows project tracking and progress monitoring
- It enhances resource management
- Risk management
- Project schedule also improves stakeholder satisfaction

7b. A Gantt chart is a visual project management tool that helps to plan and schedule projects. It looks like a horizontal bar chart showing project management timelines, task starting and ending dates, dependencies between different tasks and general project task flow.

Gantt charts are very instrumental because they help in:
- Managing milestones and deadlines
- Breaking projects into smaller tasks
- Visualizing task dependencies
- Monitoring project progress
- Easier time management at every level
- Strategic view of dependencies
- Simpler project planning
- Improved transparency

Clearly defining the problem helps in developing a more effective software solution in several ways:
i. Focuses efforts on the root cause, rather than symptoms
ii. Ensures understanding of user needs and pain points
iii. Guides requirements gathering and prioritization
iv. Helps identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for success
v. Facilitates effective communication among stakeholders
vi. Enables creation of a tailored solution, rather than a generic one
vii. Reduces scope creep and feature bloat
viii. Increases likelihood of meeting user expectation

By clearly defining the problem, you can develop a solution that:

- Addresses the actual needs and pain points
- Is user-centered and intuitive
- Meets the desired outcomes and KPIs
- Is efficient, effective, and scalable

8. a. Core Issues
i. Lack of platforms that offer solutions to given word problems 
ii. Limited availability of people who can offer their skills at solving assignments or word problems.

These issues are significant because they impact
- Provision of quality solutions to word problems or technical assignments
- Trust in online sources for solution of technical problems or assignments
- Help clients meet available vendors who lend their skills in solving such issues.
